This release is fully compatible with previous versions if was not using `AVIF` decoding before.

### Added

- (Heif) `save` method accepts optional parameter `format`. If `format="AVIF"` output file will be encoded in `h264` format using `AOM`.
- `AvifImagePlugin` introduced. Usage: `register_avif_opener()` or `import pillow_heif.AvifImagePlugin`
- After registering `AvifImagePlugin` you can work with `.avif` files the same way you do with `.heic`

This release is fully compatible with `0.5.0` version.

### Added

- `chroma=4xx` optional subsampling parameter for `save`. Equivalent to `enc_params=[("chroma", "4xx")]` in old versions.

### Changed

- `enc_params` for `save` changed type from `List[Tuple[str, str]]` to `Dict`. Old code will still work, but marked as deprecated.
- `libheif_info` now returns also bundled versions of `x265` and `aom`.
- `options().avif` marked as deprecated. Starting from `0.6.0` version to register an `AVIF` plugin there will be a separate function, and it will be disabled by default.

- XMP tags orientation that is generated by `exiftool` in some cases.
- Updated `libaom` on Linux and Windows from `3.3.0` to `3.4.0` version. MacOS builds had already that version in `0.5.0`.
- Pillow plugin now does not register `save` methods for `HEIF` format if build does not contain `HEIF` encoder(for custom build from source).
- Slight speed optimizations for working in a `Pillow` plugin mode.

## [0.5.0 - 2022-07-21]

Thumbnails were reworked, if was not use them before, then this release is fully compatible with `0.4.0` version.

- `__numpy_array__` property to `HeifFile`

- (HeifImagePlugin) During `open` `current frame` in multi frame images are set to index of `Primary Image`.
- (Heif) `add_thumbnails` method moved from `HeifFile`/`HeifImage` to separate file and now can accept a `PIL Image`.

### Fixed

- (HeifImagePlugin) Nice `speed up` for reading images having thumbnails in a `Pillow plugin` mode.
- (HeifImagePlugin) `XMP` metadata save from `TIFF` and `JPEG`.
- (HeifImagePlugin) `EXIF` metadata save from `TIFF`(only for Pillow >= 9.2).

## [0.4.0 - 2022-07-04]

### Added

- (Heif) - Numpy array interface support.
- (Heif) - `add_from_bytes` method  and `from_bytes` function added. Allows to read 16-bit color images with `OpenCV`(or any other library) and save it as 10(12) bit HEIF.
- (Heif) - `convert_to` method to `HeifImage` to provide an easy way to open 10 or 12 bit images as 16 bit for `OpenCV`(or any other library)
- (Heif, HeifImagePlugin) - support for saving images from `I`, `I;16`, `BGRA;16`, `BGR;16`, `BGRA`, `BGR` modes.
- (Heif) - added `save_to_12bit` to `options`, default `False`. Determines what bitness will have converted 16-bit images during saving.

### Changed

- **IMPORTANT!!!** `10/12` bit images changed their byte order from `Big Endian` to `Little Endian`. Probably no one still uses that API, but who knows...
- (Heif) - `HeifFile.chroma` and `HeifFile.color` properties was removed(they were not documented so probably no one will notice this), that info now stored in `mode`.
- (Heif, HeifImagePlugin) - `mode` for `10`/`12` bits was changed and accepts wider range of values, look [here](https://pillow-heif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/image-modes.html)
- Docs were `updated` & `rewritten` to reflect all those changes.

### Fixed

- `Examples` were `fixed` & `rewritten`(were broken from `0.3.1`+ versions).

- Docs: [Changes in Order Of Images](https://pillow-heif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v0.3-order-of-images.html)

### Changed

- Changed image order when multiply images present, `HeifFile` points to primary image as it was before, but it **can be not** the first image in a list.
- When using as a Pillow's plugin the only way to know is an image `Primary` or not is to perform check of `info["primary"]` value.
- (Heif) - optimized code of `HeifImageThumbnail`, added `get_original` method.

### Added

- (HeifImagePlugin) - saving of XMP tags from PNG.
- Benchmarks page to docs.

- method `thumbnails_all` returning an iterator for getting thumbnails in all images in `HeifFile`.

### Changed

- OPTIONS["avif"] and OPTIONS["strict"] replaced with `options` function, that returns `PyLibHeifOptions` class with those properties.
- if available, functions to check if image is supported `HEIF` will try to get 16 bytes instead of 12.

## [0.1.9 - 2022-03-10]

### Added

- Linux PyPy 3.7 & 3.8 wheels.
- IMPORTANT! `heif_filetype_*` constants will be deprecated in the future. Use `class HeifFiletype(IntEnum)`.
- IMPORTANT! `heif_brand_*` constants will be deprecated in the future. Use `class HeifBrand(IntEnum)`.
- Added `cfg_options` function, to change config when used not as `opener`. Look at `_options.py` for more info.
- OPTIONS: `strict` and `avif` - look at `reader.is_supported` function description.
- `class HeifErrorCode(IntEnum)` to use in custom exception handler.
- `class HeifColorspace(IntEnum)` instead of `heif_colorspace_*` constants.
- `class HeifChannel(IntEnum)` instead of `heif_channel_*` constants.
- `class HeifChroma(IntEnum)` instead of `heif_chroma_*` constants.
- A few examples of how to use.

### Changed

- `register_heif_opener` optionally accepts `**kwargs` as parameter, for overwriting values in config, when used as `opener`.
- `check_heif_magic` marked as deprecated. Use `is_supported` function instead.
- `check_heif` always return `HeifFiletype.NO` when there are less 12 bytes in input.
- Warning(`Unssuported HEIF... trying anyway`) was removed.
- `(Undecoded)HeifFile` and `HeifImageFile` classes was slightly changed(more consistent now). See the new description in README.md.
- Many other improvements and optimizations.
- When used as reader, functions `open_heif` and `read_heif` raise `HeifError` exception if file is not valid or broken.

### Fixed

- If `color_profile` is `prof` or `rICC` and data empty, `color_profile` will contain `data`=`None` instead of `color_profile`=`None`.
- `check_heif`, `is_supported`, `open_heif` and `read_heif` now preserves the file pointer, if input was a file handle.

## [0.1.8 - 2022-03-05]

### Added

- Ability to build from source on alpine with arm 7. Thanks to @aptalca

### Changed

### Added

- Windows binary wheels.
- More tests to `as_opener` module.
- Code coverage.

### Changed

- Using code formatting: black.
- Started changing build algorithms to support PEP 517.
- Speed optimizations and adjustments to `as_opener` module.
- Added `info[icc_profile]` to `HeifImageFile` when use it as `as_opener`.
- Adjustments to `reader` module:
- `pillow_heif.open` is in process of deprecation, still available, but you should use `open_heif` instead.
- `pillow_heif.check` is in process of deprecation, still available, but you should use `check_heif` instead.
- `pillow_heif.read` is in process of deprecation, still available, but you should use `read_heif` instead.

### Fixed
