## Reporting a Vulnerability

Transparency and Security are vital.
All builds are made using GitHub Actions only and for macOS Arm64 using CirrusCI.
No part of the releases is published from any local source, the release process is fully automated from start to finish.

Please report security issues using GitHub's `Private vulnerability` reporting feature.

You are also welcome to report security vulnerabilities via email to `bigcat88@icloud.com`, ensuring to include `Pillow-Heif` in the subject line.

If you do not receive a response within 48 hours, please create an issue without including technical detailsâ€”to notify about it.
