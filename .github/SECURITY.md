# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest non-alpha/beta version is supported.

Fix time is approximately from 1 to 3 days.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Transparency and Security is very important. All builds are made using GitHub Actions only and for macOS Arm64 using CirrusCI.
No part of the releases is published from any local source, the release process is fully automated from start to finish.

Please report security vulnerabilities to bigcat88@icloud.com with `Pillow-Heif` in the subject line.
If there is no response within 24 hours, then create an Issue,
without technical details, to report on the previously sent mail.
